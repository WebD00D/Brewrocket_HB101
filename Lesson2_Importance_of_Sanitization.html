                        <br />
                        If we could give you only one piece of advice when it comes to brewing, it would definitely have to be keeping your equipment, and work area sanitary.
                        The worst enemy of beer also happens to be the most common issue a new home brewer runs into â€“ contamination.
                        Did you know the standard for commercial brewery cleanliness is close to that of an operating room?
                        <br />
                        Anything that comes in contact with your wort once the boil is finished needs be both washed and sanitized.
                        Items used prior to boiling should be washed, but sanitization is not necessary - the boil will take care of this.
                        <br />
                        <b>Wash vs Sanitize</b><br />
                        Washing is simply the act of removing dust, dirt and grime from your equipment.
                        Sanitizing your equipment is a separate step to kill off remaining bacteria and micro-organisms that might linger after washing.
                        A thorough washing is a precursor to sanitizing, as sanitizing agents alone will not be able to remove built up grime and deposits on
                        equipment that harbor bacteria. But remember never use dish detergent or soap with any of your brewing equipment not even your spoons, doing so may hinder the taste of your beer.
                        <br />
                        There is an array of products you can use to help fight the attack of bad microorganisms on your beer. The brewrocket team highly recommends Star-san for sanitation and PBW for deep cleaning your equipment. *brew tip: Always be sure to thouroughly rinse your equipment after using PBW.

                        In the video below, we meet with Mike Killelea, head brew master at Center of the Universe Brewing Co. in Ashland, Virginia who went over some of the cleaning products available today.
