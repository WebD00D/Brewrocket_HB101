                        Finally, the time has come to brew. We’re happy you’ve made it this far, and didn’t just keep ‘Make my own beer’ on your bucket-list forever.
                        <br />

                        <b>So, first things first –</b><br />
                        You'll want to go over you’re brew day checklist from Lesson 3, and make sure you have everything…Check it twice!
                        <br />
                        <b>Next, you’re going to want to set up your sanitation bucket.</b> <br />
                        Follow the instructions on the sanitation product you have chosen. Once you have your sani-bucket filled, you can set it to the side for now.
                        We usually will throw equipment in there to get it out of the way too like our hydrometer, test tube, funnels, etc.
                        <br />
                        <b>Fill her up!</b>
                        <br />
                        Now let’s fill up your brew kettle up with water to the amount specified in your recipe
                        (making sure not to fill it completely to the top). Since we are doing an extract brew, you won’t have to worry about
                        calculating grain absorption – just add a little extra water to make up for the evaporation during the boil.
                        A good rule of thumb – 1.5 gallons of water gets boiled off every hour.
                        If you are not adding steeping grains, sit tight and let the water come to a boil.
                        <br />
                        <b>However, if you choose to steep grains...</b><br />
                        Then you’ll want to add them once the water has reached 150-170F in temperature.
                        Steeping grains adds fermentable sugars to your brew, as well as providing a variety of flavors and colors.
                        To steep, generally you will want to put the grains in a sleeping bag, and then immerse the bag into the water.
                        Keep in mind, once you reach the 150-170F mark, turn down your burner as you will want to steep your grains at this temperature
                        for about 30 minutes.

                        Once you are done with the steeping, it’s time to add the malt extract to your kettle.
                        <br />
                        <b>Adding the Malt Extract</b> <br />
                        Add the malt extract, turn up your burner, and wait till you start to see a foamy layer on top of the liquid.
                        While you wait, make sure to occasionally stir so that the extract doesn’t sit at the bottom of the kettle and burn.
                        When you see the foam start to form, turn down your burner until the wort is in a rolling boil.
                        <br />
                        <b>Add the Recipies Adjuncts</b>
                        <br />
                        This is also where you are going to add your first addition of hops, if your recipe calls for it.
                        The first addition of hops will add the bitterness profile to your brew.
                        For a little more detail on hops, check out our interview with Josh and Aaron of Isley Brewing Co, and for a more in depth look on the boil watch our interview with Kenny Allen of Old Ox Brewery.

                        <br />
                        Let the wort continue to boil, occasionally stirring and adding any additional adjuncts your recipe calls for until the 60 or 90 minute mark has been reached.
                        <br />
                        <b> As you approach the boil, make sure you have your ice bath set up and ready to go.</b>
                        <br />
                        The wort is in a very dangerous stage, and is prone to infection –
                        so you will want to cool it down to room temperature and pitch the yeast as quickly as possible,
                        making sure anything that comes in contact with your wort is sanitized.
                        An easy way to make your ice bath is to fill your sink up with cold water with ice, and set the covered kettle inside.
                        Never ever, ever…add ice cubes to the wort to cool it down.

                        <b>Transfer to the Fermenter</b>
                        <br />
                        Once the entire volume of wort has reached room temperature (make sure you measure at different depths and areas),
                        transfer the wort to your sanitized primary fermenter adding additional room temperature water first to make up the difference
                        you lost during the boil. It is important to make sure the wort is the same temperature as the yeast;
                        any hotter or colder could damage the yeast cells. To transfer, slowly pour the wort through a funnel into the fermenter.
                        You may need to stop occasionally and clean out the funnel filter, as broken up hops may start to clog it.
                        <br />
                        <b>Take an Original Gravity Reading</b>
                        <br />
                        Once you have gotten all of the wort transferred, take your sanitized test tube and fill it up with the wort about 80% to the top.
                        Set it on a flat surface, and use your hydrometer to take an original gravity reading.
                        Record this number, as you will need to calculate ABV later on.
                        To learn more in detail about gravity, check out our video interview with Mike Killelea.

                        <b>Pitching the Yeast</b>
                        <br />
                        Lastly, we will need to pitch your yeast. Open up your slap pack, or liquid yeast starter and carefully pour it into the fermenter.
                        Once all in, place your airlock on the fermenter, and give it a few good shakes. This is to aerate the wort, and help get the yeast active.
                        Watch our interview with Kenny Allen, Old Ox brew master explain pitching your yeast and the fermentation process.

                        Aside from the cleanup, you’re part for now is done.
                        For the next week, the yeast you just pitched is going to be working like crazy eating up all the sugars.
                        In the next lesson, we’ll talk to you a little more in depth about what’s really happening during this process.
