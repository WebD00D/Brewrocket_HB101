                        Being that water makes up around 97% of the beer you drink, it's safe to say that it plays an important role. That's why many breweries will get water samples from cities where the beer they are creating originated. For example, the water in Pilz, Czech is much different than here in the United States, therefore a pilsner made with water here will taste different than one in its birthplace. Average Joes might not taste it, but the judges will. It is amazing how much water can impact your beer.
 
                        The varying mineral levels in water have an impact on the flavor, perceived bitterness, and hop utilization of finished beer.

                        To help you better understand, we met with Tony Ammendolia, owner of Original Gravity Homebrew Supply and Final Gravity Nanobrewery, as well
                        as Brian Nelson, head brew master of Hardywood Park Craft Brewery. In the videos, you'll learn about the importance of water in brewing, as well
                        as understanding PH and what it means for your beer. If you want to learn more about the chemistry of water in beer we highly recommend using Bru'n Water. Here's the link: https://sites.google.com/site/brunwater/
