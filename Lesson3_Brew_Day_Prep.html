                        Aside from the sanitization aspect of brewing, you should also note that staying organized is almost just as important.
                        Like a pilot inspects their plane before flight, you should go through a check list before you start brewing.
                        You will want to know that all of your equipment is clean, and in working order, as well as making sure you have all the
                        ingredients needed for your recipe.
                        It’s never a fun day when you are about to pitch your yeast, and realize you forgot to pick it up! <br />
                        So, in efforts to help you avoid those “uh-oh” moments we’ve started a brew day check list for you, as well
                        as met with Mike Killelea again to talk about his brew day process.
