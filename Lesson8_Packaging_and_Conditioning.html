                        Once fermentation has completely finished, you can now package your home brew. To bottle your beer, follow our steps below:
                        <br />
                        <ul style="color:#2a2727;font-size:large;line-height:40px">
                            <li>
                                Equipment Checklist
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Long neck bottles (If you plan to recycling your purchased beer bottles, make sure they are NOT twist off – the caps won’t fit)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Auto-Siphon – This is useful for racking beer to the bottling bucket. They come in various sizes.</li>
                                    <li>Long-Handled Spoon (Preferably metal)</li>
                                    <li>Bottle Washer – This is a valve that screws into your sink faucet. You use it by inverting the bottle or carboy over it, and pressing down for water to shoot up and clean it.</li>
                                    <li>Capper</li>
                                    <li>Bottle Caps</li>
                                    <li>Filler Wand</li>
                                    <li>Plastic Tubing</li>
                                    <li>Sauce pan</li>
                                    <li>Bottling bucket</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Sanitize Equipment and Bottles
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Create your sanitization solution per the instructions on the product.</li>
                                    <li>Soak all of your bottling equipment in the solution for at least 15 – 30 minutes.</li>
                                    <li>Make sure your bottles are cleaned before you sanitize.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Create your priming solution
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The process of priming is simply adding sugar to the beer. Priming helps carbonate your brew, by giving the yeast just a little bit extra food while it’s in the bottle. You will want to use corn sugar for this (not cane!)</li>
                                    <li>To make the priming sugar solution, as a general rule of thumb, use 1 oz of priming sugar per every gallon of beer. Add a few cups of water (2-3) to a sauce pan with the priming sugar, and bring to a boil (occasionally stirring to help the sugar dissolve).</li>
                                    <li>Cover the solution, and let cool</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Add solution and beer to the bottling bucket
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Once the solution has cooled to around room temperature, add it to your bottling bucket.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Next, you’ll want to use the auto-siphon and rack your beer to the bottling bucket.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Move the bottling bucket to a higher level</li>
                                    <li>You’re going to want to utilize gravity here to help make the beer flow.</li>
                                    <li>Attach the tubing to the end of the bottling bucket spigot, and then attach the filler wand to the other end of the tubing. Open the spigot.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Fill the Bottles
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To fill, just press the wand against the bottom of the bottle to let the beer flow out, and release to stop the flow. Fill the bottles up, leaving about 1 inch of head space.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Calculate ABV
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Remember to save just a little (just enough to fill the test tube 80%). Take another gravity reading the same way you did on your brew day.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        To calculate ABV use this formula by plugging in your OG reading and Final Gravity (FG) reading:
                                        ABV = (1.05/0.79) X ((OG – FG) / FG) x 100
                                        **Where 1.05 is the number of grams of ethanol produced for every gram of CO2 produced, and .79 is the density of ethanol
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cap the bottles
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Depending on the type of capper you are using instructions will vary. If you are using the common hand-capper, rest a cap on the bottle so it sits evenly. Bring the handles of the capper together so the jaws meet around the neck of the bottle. Push the handles apart until the cap seats. Release and the cap will attach.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Store and Age
                                <ul>
                                    <li>	When storing your beer, it’s best to do so in a cool dark place inside of a cardboard box.</li>
                                    <li>At a minimum, let your beer sit for 2 weeks – although we recommend waiting it out for 6 for typically much better results.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />
