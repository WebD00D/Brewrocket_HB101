                            In this lesson we'll quickly go over the entire process from the brew day to the first pour, so you know exactly what to expect.
                            We’ll revisit each stage in more detail in future lessons to come.

                        It all starts with the brew day, followed by primary fermentation, secondary fermentation, and finished by bottling.

                        <b>Part 1: The Brew Day</b>
                        <br />

                        Beer starts its life as grain, water, hops, and yeast –
                        and it’s all up to you to transform them into the sugar liquid, that will eventually become drinkable (in about 4 – 6 weeks). During your brew days, expect to spend anywhere between 3 ½ to 4 hours (so plan your schedule accordingly) to complete all of the steps. For an extract brew, the steps you would take are as follows:



                        <ul style="font-size:large;color:#2a2727;line-height:40px">
                            <li>
                                Water is added to the kettle and heated
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Optionally, you can steep whole grains at this point for color, flavor, and body.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Liquid, or dry malt extract is added to the water to form the sweet wort.</li>
                            <li>Hops are added, and the wort is boiled for 60- 90 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Cold water is added to bring up the volume, and the wort is cooled to room temperature as quickly as possible.</li>
                            <li>Wort is transferred to the primary fermenter, and the yeast is pitched. Typically you will notice activity within 24- 48 hours.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </p>

                        <b>Part 2: Primary Fermentation</b>
                        <br />
                        Primary fermentation is the magical process where the yeast starts to eat the sugars in the wort and convert it to alcohol.
                        One of the benefits of using a glass carboy for fermentation versus a plastic bucket is the fact that you’ll be able to a
                        peak in on all the action and see all of the yeast partying it up! At this point, you can rest and let the yeast do their job
                        for about a week or so.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Part 3: Secondary Fermentation</b>
                        <br />
                        Once the yeast has started to settle down, you then can transfer the beer into the secondary fermenter.
                        Things are going to be much quieter during this stage, and you won’t notice much activity, if any at all.
                        Again, if you decide to use a glass carboy, you will only notice the yeast sediment layer at the very bottom of the container,
                        and the un-carbonated beer resting on top. You’ll want to let it sit in this stage for about two weeks to ensure the yeast have eaten
                        all the sugars.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Part 4: Bottling</b>
                        <br />
                        Man, you’re so close to being able to pop one open! Well maybe…
                        You’ll want to condition in the bottle for a minimum of two weeks,
                        but in our experience the longer you wait the better the flavor. Homebrew beer is usually good up to a year,
                        so, although tough to wait, it is well worth it!
