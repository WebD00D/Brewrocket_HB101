                        Being that water makes up around 97% of the beer you drink, it's safe to say that it plays an important role.

                        The varying mineral levels in water have an impact on the flavor, perceived bitterness, and hop utilization of finished beer.

                        To help you better understand, we met with Tony Ammendolia, owner of Original Gravity Homebrew Supply and Final Gravity Nanobrewery, as well
                        as Brian Nelson, head brew master of Hardywood Park Craft Brewery. In the videos, you'll learn about the importance of water in brewing, as well
                        as understanding PH and what it means for your beer.
