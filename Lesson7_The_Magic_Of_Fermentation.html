                        <b>Primary Fermentation</b>
                        <br />
                        It’s time to let the yeast go to work. Soon after (anywhere from 6-48 hours) you pitch the yeast,
                        you’ll start to notice some activity. The airlock will start to bubble, and foam called <b>Krausen</b> will form on top of the beer.
                        The Krausen consists of yeast and wort proteins and is a light creamy color. If you are seeing these signs, wipe off the sweat
                        from your forehead – you’ve done it right so far.
                        <br />
                        <b> Secondary Fermentation</b>
                        **This is an optional step, typically done if brewing a heavily hopped or fruit beer.
                        <br />
                        Eventually (about a week or so) the yeast will start to settle down,
                        and the Krausen will collapse. When this happens, you will know it’s time to transfer the beer
                        into the secondary fermenter. When you do the transfer (By using an auto- siphon), try to leave
                        as much of the sediment on the bottom as you can – so be gentle and try not to shake up the fermenter much.
                        Once transferred into the secondary (You set this up the same as you did with your primary), you’re beer will
                        start a mini-fermentation and the yeast will finish up their life cycle. Let your beer sit for about 2 weeks in the secondary.
                        Once you’ve notice zero activity, take a gravity reading and record it. Take another reading within the next day or so –
                        and compare it to the first. If you notice a change, let it sit for a few days and repeat the testing process.
                        If nothing has changed, you’re ready to bottle.

                        We recommend watching our interview with Brian Nelson, brew master of Hardywood Park Craft Brewery in Richmond,
                        Virginia talk more in depth about the fermentation process.
