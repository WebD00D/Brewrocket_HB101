                        <b>What is malt extract brewing?</b>
                        <br />
                        Brewing with malt extract is by far the easiest way to get started making beer –
                        in fact the majority of home brewers started this way. Malt extract is the product of mashing barley that has been
                        partially germinated, dried out, and roasted – then steeped to extract the natural sugars. The liquid from the steep is
                        then reduced until it consists of thick syrup, which is the primary ingredient we use to make the sweet liquid called wort.
                        <br />

                        The basic process consists of just boiling the malt, water, and hops together.
                        Hops are added to the wort (the term for the sweet liquid before it becomes beer) at
                        various stages of the boil to add bitterness, flavor and aroma. Finally, the last step will
                        be to pitch your yeast into the cooled wort, and let the magic happen! Pretty straight forward right?

                        <b>What equipment do I need?</b>
                        <br />
                        Aside from the pot you’ll need to boil the wort, you’re starter kit includes everything you need to
                        brew your first batch of beer: a 2 gallon fermentation bucket, 1 airlock, a thermometer, hydrometer,
                        test tube, auto siphon, sanitizer, priming sugar, 2 64oz plastic growlers, and your first recipe kit.
                        As your brewing knowledge grows, most likely so will your brewing setup.
                        Since we are just starting out with extract brewing; only minimal equipment is needed.

                        In the video below, we met up with Tony Ammendolia, owner of Original Gravity Homebrew supply in Richmond, VA who walked us through the various brewing equipment needed. Once you finish watching, we recommend opening up your supply kit (If you haven’t already) and become familiar with the different items, and how they are used. Keep in mind, if you have any detailed questions about your equipment, use our knowledge-base to find the answer, or use the slack community boards to post your question.
